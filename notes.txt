-FRB: Compound cluster RV, used in 'serve', 'nerve'

To proserve steno order F is used as S. This is the case with -ing ending words like 'using' (EWFG), 'missing' (MIFG). Same with words like 'useful' (EWFL).

To add -ing to -K (-BG) ending words, just remove the -B. Example: sticking (STIG), shaking (SHAIG).

M on the right is used for LM sounds as well. Example: balm (BAUPL)

-other ending words typed with OER. Example: brother (BROER)

-ithm ending words are stroked with *EUPLT since *T makes the TH sound, and PL makes the M sound. Example: rhythm (R*EUPLT), algorithm (ALG/R*EUPLT)

	ex- -> EBGS/... or SK-...
